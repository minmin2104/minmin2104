# 🌸 Selamat Datang (It's “welcome” in Malay)

💡 A little bit about me

Hey 👋, I've been programming since 2019. This is my new GitHub.
I'm just starting over after a mental health phase 🌧️➡️🌤️. I plan to
make this journey as fun as possible and learn a lot. No more
unhealthy grinding 💪. I also love neuropsychology 🧠 lately
while also exploring how to change myself for the better 🌱.

## 🛠️ What kind of stuff do I make?

Current me loves everything about programming 💻. So I like to make
anything that's fun 🎮 — that would allow me to explore more and more.
As you can see, my current project on this GitHub is kind of basic 🐣.
But hey, I'm trying to enjoy programming from the little things that
made it fun when I first started ✨. Also it's great to build momentum
after my mental health phase and a long time of not doing programming ⚡.

## 🎯 Focusing on

My plan is to stick with Python 🐍 for the time being. But in the past, I
wrote a lot of C ⚙️ and Golang 🌀. I love it. Still do ❤️.

## 🧰 The tools

- 🪟 Windows
- 🧠 Vanilla Emacs

I daily drive linux in the past, but now since that laptop is dead, and I'm on a new one, I'm sticking with windows for a while.
