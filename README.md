# Selamat Datang (It's welcome in malay)

## A little bit about me

Hey, I've been programming since 2019. This is my new github.
I'm just starting over after a mental health phase. I plan to
make this journey as fun as possible and learn a lot. No more
unhealthy grinding.I also love neuropsychology stuff lately 
while also exploring how to change myself for the better.

## What kind of stuff do I make?

Current me loves everything about programming. So I like to make
anything that's fun. That would allow me to explore more and more.
As you can see, my current project on this Github is kind of basic.
But hey, I'm trying to enjoy programming from the little things that
makes it fun when I first started. Also it's great to build momentum
after my mental health phase and a long time of not doing programming.

## Focusing on

My plan is to stick with Python for the time being. But in the past, I
wrote a lot of C and Golang. I love it. Still do.

## The tools

- Fedora Linux
- Old laptop
- Neovim, Tmux, Git

That's all we need baby. Sometimes emacs. Emacs is fun too.
